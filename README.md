# minikvm
The smallest possible way to control a server using a rasspberrypie
Currently only manuel controll is fully working.
The only thing requierd for it to work is a dual channel relay wich can be cheaply bought.

ToDo:
☑️ Add automatik up keeping
☑️ Add async 
☑️ Add server to interact in a better way
